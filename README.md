Project Overview
This academic project investigates how effectively machine learning models can predict loan approval outcomes using applicant demographic and financial data. The study applies three supervised classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

The primary goal is to evaluate the accuracy, interpretability, and practical deployment potential of these models for automating loan decision processes in financial institutions.

Research Objectives
To apply data preprocessing and visualization techniques to the loan approval dataset.

To build and train classification models including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost.

To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

To identify the most important features influencing loan approval predictions.

To assess the feasibility of implementing the best-performing model in real-world scenarios.

Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle

Dataset Title: Loan Approval Prediction Dataset

URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset

Records: 4269

Features: Applicant income, CIBIL score, employment status, education, asset values, and loan status

Target Variable: Loan status (Approved or Rejected)

The dataset is anonymised and synthetically generated. It represents realistic financial and demographic patterns based on typical banking criteria in the Indian lending context.
